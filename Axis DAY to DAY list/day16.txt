KOTLIN PROGRAMING LANGUAGE
    =>General pupose PROGRAMING language
    =>Function based
    =>object based PROGRAMING language

    =>Back-end development(back-end web development) nodejs(javascript) pyhton django
    =>server-side development(kotlin)(microservice)
    =>Android development(kotlin) java as back-end for Android (kotlin official language)

   =>2016 
   =>2013

google make kotlin as an official language for Android

        =>spring cloud,spring boot in java and kotlin
        =>microservice

    Advantage kotlin
     =>   it's help build less code for any application
        quality of code with little quanty of code
        concise approch
     =>  kotlin is compatible with java     
                kotlin is build on top of JVM
     =>  strong community
     =>  it will accept both function based oject based approch of development
     => it will help us to avoid null point execption


java vs kotlin
    =>1996
    =>kotlin it's you need metion data type at every time when yor using variable
    =>dont need to mention data data it will depend on data which is holding


javascript
    dynamic PROGRAMING language
        var name="surya";
        name=23;

    history of kotlin
        =>jetBrains company
        =>intellij  => is best idle for kotline
        =>2010
        =>2016 after 20 year of java
        =>2016 official language Android 2018

variables in kotlin

    =>is a memory location  to store data

    to declaration
     in kotlin
        var variablename=data;
        val variablename=data;

    difference b/w var and val
            the var variable is mutable the value of variable can be chage

            the val variable is immutable value canotbe chage


    data type in kotlin
        number
            =>Byte
            =>Int
            =>Short
            =>Long
            =>Float
            =>Double
        character
           =>Char
        boolean
            =>Boolean
        array
            Array/arrayof()
        string
            =>String


        to convert to data rom one type another type
            toInt();
            toLong()
            toByte();
            toShort();
            toFloat();
            toDouble();

        
        opertor
            Arithmetic opertor
            +,-,*,/,%
            ralation opertor
            >,<,>=,<=,==,!=
            Assignment opertor
            =,+=,-=,*=,/=,%=
            unary operator
            ++,--,!
            logical operator
            &&,||,!
            Bitwise
            shl(bits) shift left
            shr(bits)  shift right
            and(variable)   var a=10;
            or(variable)    var b=20;
            xor(variable)   a.and(b)

  read data from user in kotline
          readLine()  
        //scanf()  

Expressions(statments)
    =>if()  if(codition){

    }
    =>if(){}else{}
    =>nested if statments
    =>lader if statments

looping
    =>for
    =>while
    =>do whuile
    =>jump statments
    break
    continue

    label for looping
    =>we can give name for the looping
    @ symbol for give label

kotlin function
    block of code of which which used to perform perticular task
    =>function help us use that blok of code whenever we want by calling function

        =>user defined function
        =>standard function 

    if we want to create any function in kotlin use keyword called fun
        syntax of fun
        fun function(parameters):returntype{
                statments
            }

        we can create name less function

        we can create function without name 
            =>lambda Expressions
            
            syntax

            (variabletype list)->{body of the function}


    Array
        =>collection of same type elements 
        =>all element in array have same datatype

    create array in kotline we have to create using array object Array constructore

        var arrayname=Array(Size:Int)

        int[] array=new int[size]

    if we already know elements of array we can use 
       var arrayname= arrayOf(elements list)


Exception handling
    keywords in Exception 
    =>try 
    catch 
    finaly
    throw
    throws

    =>error will accour at runtime that error are called Exception
     to that handle that errors we need execption
