MongoDb
    =>why dataBase managment system?
        =>to organize data
        =>access will be easy
        =>big data can be maintain easy
        =>to make crud operation on that data will be easy

SQL dataBase    
    Structured(Relational Data Base)
        what are data you store in sql all the data will be in the form of tables ad inside row with attributes of that tables

        user data
            name place age DOB company second
            surya delhi 27 1996 ms
            shree delhi 27 1996 null

in sql it always follow the schema

        web page asking user details
            =>we have to take all this field that are metion in the tables
    
    =>schema approch difficult to maintain for large amount of data set
    =>schema oriented dataBase
    =>sql data base managment system will very slow
    =>join in sql will be very slow approch
    =>foreign key effect
    =>slect name from user;

            bank tables
            user tables
            account tables  
                userid
                bankid

nosql will don't follow any schema

            no sql they is no realtion b/w data 
            document-oriented dataBase
        =>10gen company MongoDb license
        =>open source
        =>mongodb commerical unit Atlas clound dataBase
        =>mongodb community version
        =>mongodb is a scalable dataBase 
        =>it hold huge data set compare to mysql 150000 
        =>mongodb will use magerly commodity server 
            =>Amazon application
                =>shopping
                    =>computer=>details ,book=>details
                    we no need to follow any Structured     collection block
                                                            user{name,age,place}

                mongodb was developed 2007
                    =>when this commodity server
                    =>PAAS(platform as a service)
                    =>SAAS(So0ftware as a serviec)
                    =>dataBase managment system for ost of company
                Advantage
                =>performance of mongodb
                =>crud mongodb easy
                =>develop dataBase is faster than sql   
                =>scalability of mongodb is high(Bigger data set)

    =>to list collection in db 
        show collections
    =>to create collection in db
        db.createCollection('collection_name')

    =>insert document inside collection

    update data in document 
        db.collection_name.update({name:'surya'},{$set:{'age':28}})
    =>if wwe use upsert:true it will add that filed to the document if it in not present in that document
       db.collection_name.update({name:'surya'},{$set:{'age':28}},{upsert:true})
        update operator in mongodb
        =>all operators in mongodb will start with $ symbol
        $set
            =>will help us to update the filed value inside that document
        $inc
            =>which help us to inrement the perticular value by given value
            db.users.update({name:'sharath'},{$inc:{age:2}})
        $min
            =>which help us to modify that perticular field value if the new value is less than current value
                    age=22
                    age=24
                db.college.update({name:'mitt'},{$min:{noyear:13}})

        $max
                =>which will update the field value if curret upate value greater than curret document value
                db.college.pdate({name:'mit'},{$max:{noyear:15}})
        $rename
                =>it will help us to update tyhe field name to new value
                db.college.update({name:'mit'},{$rename:{noyear:'totalYear'}})
        $unset
                this will help us to remove perticular field from the document
                db.college.update({name:'mit'},{$unset:{noyear:13}})

        filed and value
            {
                name:'mit',
                place:'delhi',
                brachs:['cs','is','ec']
                rankOfBranch:[{branch:'cs',rank:4},{branch:'is',ranck:4}]
            }

    $push
            =>if we want to add any value to the array in document field we have to use push
            db.college.update({name:'mit'},{$push:{branchs:'eee'}})
        branch field will update to ['cs','is'] => ['cs','is','eee']
    $pop
            =>to remove any elements from array field
    $pull
            =>will search that perticular element and remove 
            db.college.update({name:'mit'},{$pull:{branchs:'eee',branchs:'cs'}},{multi:true})

    for limit 
         db.college.find().limit(3)
    find with condition
        db.college.find({name:'mite'})
    delete array element in filed using pull
        db.college.update({name:'mit'},{$pull:{branchs:'eee'}},{multi:true})
    delete last elemet in array field
        db.college.update({name:'mit'},{$pop:{branchs:1}})
    delete first element in array field
        db.college.update({name:'mit'},{$pop:{branchs:-1}})
    to add element in array
        db.college.update({name:'mit'},{$push:{rankOfBranch:{branch:'ec',ranck:3.5}}})
    
    for sort dcument by perticular filed we use sort method
                     key   1:ascending orders
                          -1:descending order
            db.college.find().sort(age:1)

    remove all elements in documents ,collection,databases
        =>delete doument from collection
            remove method to delete document from collection
            db.college.remove({codition})
            if you want to remove all documents 
            db.college.removeAll()
            db.college.remove({name:'mitt'})
        =>to delete collection from db
            we have to sue drop
            db.collection_name.drop()
        =>to delete dataBase from mongodb
            we have to use drop
            db.database_name.drop()
            =>if you want any dataBase you must use that dataBase first
                use database_name;
                db.dropDatabase();
                after drop switch to other dataBase


ex
        orders
        productid productname,product batry,screan
